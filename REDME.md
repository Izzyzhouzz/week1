## Activities and Descriptions
### Survey
Students participating in research take the AI attitudes and opinions pre-survey on computers. The survey consists of 40 questions and is expected to take students ~15 minutes.

### AI Experiences Bingo
Students grab a bingo card and talk to their classmates about their experiences with AI. To mark off an item, they need their classmate to share the experience. First one to 5 in a row wins!

### Imagine AI Game
In small groups, students brainstorm as many use cases for AI as possible in 8 minutes. After 8 minutes, each group shares and gets 1 point for every original idea. An extra 5 points goes to the teams with the silliest, most useful, and most unexpected ideas.
